The former only exerts an instantaneous function when the heart is damaged, while the latter exerts a passive effect when the heart is not harmed. The first custom heart you eat will be on the far left of the health bar, and the heart after that will move to the right. The cooling of the custom heart is carried out from left to right, that is, when the left heart does not finish cooling, the right heart will not begin to cool."
