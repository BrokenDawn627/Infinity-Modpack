After obtaining this effect, wait for the dragon egg to hatch next to the dragon egg (for a long time). Use raw meat or orc skins to tame the Ender Dragon, after which you wait for the Ender Dragon to reach adulthood. When the Ender Dragon enters the adult stage, it can equip the dragon saddle and ride, and enter the prime stage to breathe fire."
