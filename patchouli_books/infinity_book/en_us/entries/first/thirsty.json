Here are some items that can filter water. The $(br) boiling pot needs to be placed on a campfire, use the bucket to add water to the boiling pot, and wait a little while to get pure water. You can use a glass bottle or a flask to serve it. Water filled with a flask will replenish more of your thirst."
